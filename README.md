# Python Discord Code Jam 8 (Summer 2021)

Theme: Think Inside the Box

## The original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/doublevcodes/inside-the-box), now that it is public

## Project Details

We are "inside" the box, Rubik's cube to be exact.

## What does the project currently do?

When you run the program, you can see the inside of a Rubick's cube inside the terminal.

The theme was inside the box, so we literally (figuratively) placed you inside the box. Our box being Rubick's cube. If you were inside an actual cube you would be able to see 5 sides of the cube with one face not visible as humans don't have eyes on the back of thier head.

## Installation


For running the program blessed library along with standard python is enough. You can install blessed by simply running `pip install blessed`


## What could've been?

If we were vigilant enough we would've made the program so that User when pressed different keys would actually able to manipulate the cube.

The cube would rotate faces, change colours and we would give Users an option to scramble the cube and they would then solve it. Alas, it wasn't finished in time.

## To do

* The loading and saving of the cube from config
* Rotate the cube in the view
* The ability to actually rotate sides of the cube
* Few code improvements
